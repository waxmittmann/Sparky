Messing about with Spark
========================
Yeah, I know 14MB is not big data, but whatevs! Playing around and doing a bit of number crunching on stackoverflow dev questionnaire data.

Comes with a super-basic webpage in `web`. Have a look:
https://rawgit.com/waxmittmann/Sparky/master/web/index.html

Takeaways:
- Working 0 hours makes you happy!
- Women aren't having as good a time :(
- Use IntelliJ, VisualStudio or (sigh) XCode for optimal happiness; avoid vim at all costs!

Caveat:
- this is totally not statistically validated at all, no idea whether anything here is statistically significant :P
